```


## Setup

Please start a new R Project for today called `Practical_2`.

1. `File` > `New Project` 
2. When asked if you'd like to `Save Current Workspace`, choose `Don't Save`.
3. Choose `New Directory` > `New Project`
    + Enter `Practical_2` as the Directory name:
    + `Create Project`

Although most of what we're doing can be done in the Console, please start a new R Script for today and save this as `TextManipulation.R`.
A good habit to get into is to write a line (or two) explaining what is happening on the following line, then have your code.
Try and get into this habit of writing messages for the future version of yourself, or for other collaborators.
Remember, each *comment* starts with a `#` and this is what we need to write ourselves messages.
Otherwise `R` will try and execute what we are writing and you'll see horrible error messages.

## The package `stringr`

Last week, we learned how to:

1. import data (`readr`)
2. tidy data (`tidyr`)
3. use SQL-like syntax to manipulate data (`dplyr`)
4. chain functions together using the magrittr (`%>%`)

As we continue our exploration of Data Wrangling, we'll introduce a very useful package for working with any text strings (or character vectors), known as `stringr`.
This package is also part of the core `tidyverse`.
In the `Wrangle` section of the following workflow you'll see it listed alongside `dplyr` and `magrittr` (`%>%`).
The package `lubridate` is excellent for managing time & date data, whilst `forcats` is for categorical data, however we won't really explore these in this course.

![](images/tidy_workflow.png)

Some immediately useful functions in the `stringr` package are `str_to_lower()`, `str_to_upper()` and `str_to_title()`.
Let's load last week's pcr.csv file to have a look.

```{r, results='hide'}
library(tidyverse)
pcrFile <- file.path("~", "data", "intro_r", "pcr.csv")
file.exists(pcrFile)
pcrData <- read_csv(pcrFile)
```

We can actually just grab the `Gene` column out from this `tibble` using the `$` symbol followed by the column name.
Note that auto-complete will be your friend here.

```{r}
pcrData$Gene
```

Here all the genes are given as upper case, but what our collaborators failed to realise is that these are *mouse* genes.
Only *human* genes follow the convention of every letter being upper-case, whilst *mouse* genes have only the first letter as upper-case.
Here `stringr` is our friend and we can use the function `str_to_title()`.
(There are no bold or italic fonts in the R Console so we can't really distinguish genes and proteins.)

```{r}
str_to_title(pcrData$Gene)
```

Notice how we're able to modify a whole set of values (i.e. a column or character vector) with only one command.
If we wanted to do this in Excel, we'd have to go to a blank column, call the function `PROPER` and point it to the first value in the column to be converted, then fill down until we have all the values in a new column.

R gives us at least two ways to replace these values.
The first would be using `mutate()`

```{r}
pcrData <- mutate(pcrData, Gene = str_to_title(Gene))
```

The second would be to use the `$` operator to extract just the single column.

```{r}
pcrData$Gene <- str_to_title(pcrData$Gene)
```

Explore what you can do with `str_to_lower()` and `str_to_upper()` just to get a feel for them.

## Regular Expressions

### Text Manipulation 

Regular Expressions are an important concept in `R`, `bash` and most common languages used for bioinformatics.
Matching obvious patterns uses a simple syntax.
The first argument is the original `string`, which is followed by the search `pattern` and the `replacement`.
Here we are searching the `string` "Hi Mum" for the `pattern` "Mum", and replacing  with the string "Dad".

```{r}
str_replace(string = "Hi Mum", pattern = "Mum", replacement =  "Dad")
```

Note that we didn't technically need specify the argument name as we called them in order.
A more succinct version of the above code would be.

```{r}
str_replace("Hi Mum", "Mum", "Dad")
```

- **Which do you think is easier to read, and which do you think your future self would like to see?**
- **Which is easiest to type? Does auto-complete help at all?**

### Wild-cards

In regular expression syntax, we specify wild-cards as `.` which means "match anything".
This is quite different to many other contexts where we would use an asterisk (`*`) as a wild-card.
Asterisks have a different meaning entirely when using regular expressions.

```{r}
str_replace(string = "Hi Mum", pattern = "M..", replacement = "Dad")
```

We can also match one or more wild-cards by using `+`, so in the following we are searching for `M` followed by *anything*, *one or more times*.

```{r}
str_replace(string = "Hi Mum", pattern = "M.+", replacement = "Dad")
str_replace(string = "Hi Mother", pattern = "M.+", replacement = "Dad")
```

### Text captures

We can also capture words/phrases/patterns using the round brackets containing or target `(pattern)`.
We can then return these in the order we capture them by using the double backslash symbol followed by their capture number.
*The double backslash is `R`-specific syntax and won't apply when we move to bash in a couple of weeks*.

```{r}
str_replace(string = "Hi Mother", pattern = "(H.+) (M.+)", replacement = "\\2! \\1!")
```

Note the strategic use of spaces in the patterns to recognise and return.

### Specific character sets

We can also specify strict ranges of values instead of wild-cards by placing options inside square brackets (`[]`) during the pattern matching.
It's also worth noticing that the function `str_replace()` will only replace the first instance in each string, whilst `str_replace_all()` will replace *all* instances.

```{r}
str_replace("Hi Mum", "[Mm]", "b")
str_replace_all("Hi Mum", "[Mm]", "b")
str_replace_all("Hi Mum", "[aeiou]", "o")
str_replace_all("Hi Mum", "[a-z]", "o")
```

### Alternative Patterns

Alternative patterns can be specified using the conventional `OR` symbol `|` inside the curved brackets.
Think vary carefully about the following substitutions to make sure you can see what's happening.

```{r}
str_replace_all("Hi Mum", "(Mum|Dad)", "Parent")
str_replace_all("Hi Dad", "(Mum|Dad)", "Parent")
str_replace_all("Hi Dad", "Hi (Mum|Dad)", "Dear Beloved Parent")
```

## Additional Functions

We have only just scratched the surface of text manipulation.
Many other functions that may come in handy are:

- `str_detect()`: Return a `TRUE` or `FALSE` value for each tested character string
- `str_count()`: Count the number of appearances of a character.
- `str_extract()` / `str_extract_all()`: extract just the given string from our query
- `str_remove()` / `str_remove_all()`: removes the given pattern

Note that we've switched to a `magrittr` style of syntax here.

There is no right or wrong answer. It's up to you... 
</details><br>


```{r}
pcrData$Gene %>% str_detect("A")
pcrData$Gene %>% str_count("[A-C]")
colnames(pcrData) %>% str_extract("(Resting|Stim)")
colnames(pcrData) %>% str_remove_all("hr")
```

Whilst all of the above return a character vector *of the same length as the original*, some other functions do not.
If we wanted to split our treatments using the column names, we could use `str_split()` or more conveniently `str_split_fixed()` which allows us to specify how many columns to form from the original data.

```{r}
colnames(pcrData) %>% str_split_fixed("_", n = 2)
```
