## Data Visualisation Using the Package `ggplot2`

### The package `graphics`

`R` has numerous plotting functions in the base package `graphics`.
Whilst they can be useful for quickly drawing up a plot, customising them can prove highly challenging.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?plot
?boxplot
?hist
```

__Go to the `Examples` at the bottom of each help page and copy a few lines__

The package `ggplot2` gives much more flexibility and power.
However, it has a unique syntax and approach where we plot by adding layers of relevant information, based on the concepts outlined in [The Grammar of Graphics](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9780387245447).
As a result, we won't explore the base `graphics` capabilities of `R` any further as `ggplot2` is generally far superior.
`ggplot2` is also one of the core `tidyverse` packages.

### The package `ggplot2` 

Start a new script for this topic called `DataVisualisation.R` and add the usual first line.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

We'll also use the transport dataset from our previous session.
This time, we'll just overwrite the `height` column with the same values in *m* instead of *cm*.
We'll also remove `X1` and add the BMI information directly as we're loading the data.
Hopefully you can see the usefulness of the `%>%` from this example.
This way we never need to edit our raw data files, but perform all manipulation in `R` in a completely reproducible manner.
This strategy also allows for additional data to be provided as more experiments or data points are added.

**Remember to load all packages at the top of your `R` script for easier reference in the future!**

```{r}
csvFile <- file.path("~", "data", "intro_r", "transport.csv")
file.exists(csvFile)
data <- read_csv(csvFile) %>%
  mutate(height = height/100, BMI = weight / height^2) %>%
  select(-X1)
data
```

The main `ggplot2` function is `ggplot()`.
In this first stage we first *define the aesthetic mappings using* `aes()`.
These simply define what is plotted on which axis, and what defines the colour/shape etc.
When calling this function alone **no data will be plotted**, and we get a blank plot area only.

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height))
```

### Adding geometry

After defining the aesthetic mappings, we:

1. Tell R that "*more is to come*" by adding a `+` symbol at the end of the line
2. Add the required geometry using various `geom_...()` functions

Let's start by plotting points, for which we need `geom_point()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point()
```

There are numerous aesthetics specifically available for `geom_point()`, so let's check the help page.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
?geom_point
```

We can colour points, so let's do this based on the `transport` column.
Note that if we add this during the call to `ggplot()` this will be passed down to every subsequent `geom_*` that we call.

```{r, fig.show='hide'}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height, colour = transport)) +
  geom_point()
```

We can also specify the shape to represent another variable, such as `gender`.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height, colour = transport, shape = gender)) +
  geom_point()
```

Let's leave the general aesthetics in `ggplot()`, with the colour and the shape aesthetics being specifically assigned to the points.
Whilst this looks the same on the plot, this will help as we build up the complexity of the plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = transport, shape = gender))
```

Anything set outside of the `aes()` function are general across all points.
Here we can make all points larger.
Size is a relative scale and doesn't specifically represent a value in pixels, mm or anything similar.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = transport, shape = gender), size = 3)
```

### Layering Multiple Geometry Types

In addition to the points, we can easily add a smoothed line.
This defaults to a loess fit, so let's select a regression line straight away by setting the `method` argument to `"lm"`.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = transport, shape = gender)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

By default, the standard errors for the line are represented by shading, and we can remove these bands by setting `se = FALSE`.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = transport, shape = gender)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)
```


### Axis and Legend Labels

Axis and legend labels can be added using `labs()`.
The default values are the column names, so we can tidy those up fairly easily.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = transport, shape = gender)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Height (m)", shape = "Gender", colour = "Transport")
```


### Using Facets

One of the most useful features of `ggplot2` is the ability to create multiple sub-plots using the function `facet_wrap()`.
Let's create separate plots based on the `gender` column.
This will also plot separate regression lines.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = weight, y = height)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = transport, shape = gender)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Weight (kg)", y = "Height (cm)", shape = "Gender", colour = "Transport") +
  facet_wrap(~gender) 
```

In important piece of syntax we have just seen for the first time is the use of the tilde (`~`).
In `R` this is how we often define statistical models, and con often be interpreted as *depends on*, so in this call to `facet_wrap()` we are asking `ggplot` to draw facets that depend on the values in the `gender` column.

### Different geoms

Enter `geom_` in the Console followed by the `tab` key.
Numerous options will appear such as `geom_density()` and `geom_boxplot()`.
You may need to think carefully about what is plotted on which axis for some of these so pay careful attention.

Here's `geom_density()` setting a degree of transparency to look amazing.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = height, fill = gender)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.5)
```

We can easily make boxplots.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gender, y =height, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

We could plot separate facets based on the transport method as well.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gender, y =height, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_wrap(~transport)
```

Histograms use `geom_histogram()`

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20)
```

These tend to look terrible out of the box and need a little tweaking though.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = height)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20, fill = "grey50", colour = "black")
```


## Combining With `dplyr`

We can use `dplyr` (or any other) function to summarise our data before plotting, then _pipe_ (`%>%`) into `ggplot()` without modifying our original data object.
As we saw last time, this is loaded by default when we called `library(tidyverse)`.

Let's start working towards a barplot with error bars, which will use `geom_bar()`.
`geom_bar()` has a slightly unusual set of default arguments, so we will need to provide the argument `stat = "identity"`.
This simply tells `geom_bar()` to use the values provided and not to try summing anything before plotting.

```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(transport, gender) %>%
  summarise(mn_height = mean(height), sd_height = sd(height)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = transport, y = mn_height, fill = transport)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  facet_wrap(~gender) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

To add error bars we now just use `geom_errorbar()`

```{r}
data %>%
  group_by(transport, gender) %>%
  summarise(mn_height = mean(height), sd_height = sd(height)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = transport, y = mn_height, fill = transport)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_errorbar(
    aes(ymin = mn_height - sd_height, ymax = mn_height + sd_height),
    width = 0.6
  ) +
  facet_wrap(~gender) +
  guides(fill = FALSE)
```

Notice that `geom_errorbar()` needed a lot of information, so we spread our code out across multiple lines.
This is a fairly useful trick for making your code more readable at a later point in time.


## Bonus Material

**Please only attempt this section if you have more than an hour left of the practical session. Otherwise, this is simply here as a helpful guide for future reference.**

### Setting Themes

`ggplot2` uses the idea of themes to control the overall appearance.
The default has white grid-lines and a grey background, with a good alternative being `theme_bw()`.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gender, y = height, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw()
```

Try some of the alternatives like `theme_void()` and `theme_classic()`

The `theme()` function is also where you set `axis.text`, `legend` and a whole raft of other attributes.
The syntax often uses _elements_ to set an attribute, which can take a while to come to grips with.
Let's check the help page.

```{r}
?theme
```

As an example, changing text within themes uses `element_text()`

```{r}
?element_text
```

Let's change the text on the x-axis of our last plot.
Hopefully this gives you enough ideas on how to customise your own plots.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gender, y = height, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, vjust = 0.5))
```

<details><summary><b>What do hjust and vjust do in the above code?</b></summary>
They control the horizontal and vertical adjustment of the text, using the direction of the letters as the reference point.
`hjust = 1` means right alignment of the text in the horizontal direction, whilst `vjust = 0.5` means centre alignment in the vertical direction.
Both these values take vales between 0 & 1.
</details>

### Legend Positions

We can also move the legend to multiple places:

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gender, y = height, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

Or we can use co-ordinates to place it inside the plotting region.
This method treats the plot area as a grid of `width = height = 1`.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gender, y = height, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15))
```

### Colours and Axes

The scale of axes or fill colours can also be set manually to be reverse or on the log10 scale.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = gender, y = height, fill = gender)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.85, 0.15)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(1.5, 2)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("grey70", "lightblue"))
```

In the last line of the above, we've also set the colour manually.
Once you get used to this plotting approach, it's very easy to customise and make great looking plots.
